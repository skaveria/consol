* 1. What Consol Is

Consol is a thin, document-native operating layer for small Linux devices.

It provides a clear, inspectable control surface over:
- system state
- services
- deployment
- events
- memory

Consol does not replace the kernel.
Consol does not attempt to be a desktop environment.
Consol does not attempt to be a general-purpose framework.

Consol exists to reduce impedance between intent and machine.

* 2. Why Consol Exists

Modern devices are powerful but obscured.

We carry multi-core processors and gigabytes of memory in our pockets, yet access to them is increasingly abstracted, opaque, and application-bound.

Consol restores:
- legibility
- inspectability
- composability
- structural clarity

It does not increase complexity.
It removes unnecessary layers.

* 3. Core Principles

** Restore Dignity
Machines should be understandable.

** Minimize Impedance
Nothing unnecessary should sit between intention and execution.

** Structure Over Cleverness
Prefer simple composable primitives over dense abstraction.

** Documentation Lives With Code
Public functions require docstrings.
Data shapes are explicit.
No external wikis as primary documentation.

** Immutable Substrate
All meaningful changes are events.
Derived state must be reproducible.

** Wizard at the REPL, Discipline in the Repository
Exploration is free.
Committed code is calm and readable.

* 4. Architectural Model

Consol is composed of four layers:

** Core
- Event model
- Datalevin backing store
- Immutable logic

** IO Edge
- HTTP
- File system
- Git
- Process invocation

** Surface
- Minimal HTML rendering
- Text-first presentation
- Black/white readable

** Commands
- deploy
- restart
- inspect
- status

Layers must not bleed into one another.

* 5. Event Model

Everything meaningful is an event.

Each event must contain:
- type
- timestamp
- actor
- payload
- version

State is derived from events.
State is never silently mutated.

* 6. Code Standards

- One idea per file.
- Top-of-file contract comment.
- All public functions include docstrings.
- No deeply nested anonymous lambdas.
- No clever naming.
- Clear English identifiers.
- Prefer small functions.

The goal is not minimal lines of code.
The goal is maximal clarity.

* 7. Visual Language

Consol is:
- Text-first
- Minimal
- Monospace-forward
- Black-and-white legible
- Print-friendly
- Free of decorative animation

The surface is a lens, not a spectacle.

* 8. Scope of 0.1

Consol 0.1 includes:
- HTTP control surface
- Datalevin event store
- Basic deploy command
- Status view
- Service registry

Consol 0.1 excludes:
- authentication systems
- plugin systems
- analytics dashboards
- embedded LLM features
- over-abstraction

0.1 is defined by coherence, not features.

* 9. Identity

Con Sol is the symbolic observer of the operating layer.

He is observant.
He values clarity.
He reduces friction.

Consol is a lens over small machines.
